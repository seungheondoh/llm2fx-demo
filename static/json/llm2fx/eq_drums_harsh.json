    "reason": "The harsh sound for drums is achieved by a combination of shelving and peaking filters. A low-shelf boost around 20Hz with a narrow Q-factor adds weight and resonance to the low-end, a low peaking cut around 100Hz reduces muddiness, a notch around 400Hz reduces boxiness, a boost around 800Hz increases attack and presence, a low-gain band around 1.5kHz adds clarity, and a high-shelf boost around 8kHz increases sibilance and brightness."
