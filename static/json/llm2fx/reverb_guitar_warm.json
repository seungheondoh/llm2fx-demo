    "reason": "The warm guitar sound is achieved by boosting the lower and mid-frequency bands to increase the richness and body of the sound, while the higher frequency bands are slightly attenuated to avoid harshness. The decay times are set to medium values to create a spacious and enveloping reverb without excessive ringing. The mix level is adjusted to balance the reverb with the dry signal."
