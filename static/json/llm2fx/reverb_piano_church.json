    "reason": "The reverb for a church sound is designed to create a spacious, cathedral-like atmosphere. The gain values increase with frequency to simulate the resonance of a large space, while the decay times decrease with frequency to accurately represent the natural decay of sound in such a space. The mix level is set to achieve a balanced blend between the dry signal and the reverb."
