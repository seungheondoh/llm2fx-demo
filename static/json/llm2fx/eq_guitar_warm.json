    "reason": "To create a warm sound for guitar, the low shelf filter is boosted at 200 Hz to add richness and warmth to the lower frequencies. The first band is a cut at 600 Hz to reduce muddiness, followed by a boost at 1500 Hz to emphasize the lower mid-range. A cut at 2500 Hz in the second band removes harshness, while the third band maintains a neutral response. The high shelf filter is flat to avoid adding any unwanted brightness."
