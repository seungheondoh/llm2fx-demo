    "reason": "To create a warm sound for piano, we boost the low-end frequencies to increase fullness and richness, while cutting the higher frequencies to reduce harshness. The low shelf emphasizes frequencies below 20 Hz, providing a deep, resonant sound. The high-end cut reduces shrillness and excessive brightness."
