    "reason": "Designed a warm sound for piano by applying a boost to the lower and middle frequency bands, creating a rich and full-bodied character. The decay times gradually increase to emphasize the warmth and produce a sense of intimacy. The mix level is set to achieve a balanced blend between the dry signal and the reverb."
