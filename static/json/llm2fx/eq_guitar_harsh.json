    "reason": "A harsh sound for guitar is achieved by reducing the warmth (low frequencies) with a low shelf cut (-6dB at 200Hz), boosting the high mid frequencies (2dB at 1.2kHz and 4dB at 3kHz) to accentuate the harshness, and adding a high shelf boost (3dB at 12kHz) to further emphasize the treble."
