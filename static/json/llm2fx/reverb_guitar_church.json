    "reason": "The parameters are designed to create a cathedral-like reverb effect suitable for a guitar. Lower frequencies are boosted to emphasize the body of the guitar, while higher frequencies are attenuated to reduce harshness. The longer decay times simulate the long reverberation typical of a large, open space."
