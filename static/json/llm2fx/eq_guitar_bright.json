    "reason": "The EQ parameters focus on enhancing the higher frequencies to create a brighter sound for a guitar. The low shelf is cut to remove excess low-end energy, and the mid-range frequencies are kept relatively flat to maintain presence and tone clarity. A moderate boost in the lower treble frequencies, combined with a significant high shelf boost, helps to increase the perceived brightness while avoiding harshness."
