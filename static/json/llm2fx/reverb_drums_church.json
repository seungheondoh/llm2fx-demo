    "reason": "The reverb for church sound for drums is designed with a mix of high and mid frequencies boosted to mimic the reverberant nature of large church spaces. Low frequencies are slightly attenuated to prevent muddiness. The decay times are medium-long to allow the sound to trail off naturally, creating a sense of space and ambience. The mix level is adjusted to balance the reverb and dry signals."
