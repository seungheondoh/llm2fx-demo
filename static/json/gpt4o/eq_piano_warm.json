    "reason": "To achieve a warm sound for the piano, a boost in the low frequencies around 150 Hz enhances the body and richness. Slight boosts around 300 Hz and 500 Hz further reinforce the warmth by accentuating the lower midrange, giving the sound depth. A mild cut at 2500 Hz reduces any harshness or excessive brightness. Finally, applying a gentle cut in the high frequencies above 8000 Hz smooths out any sharp overtones, maintaining the warm character without losing the natural brightness of the piano."
