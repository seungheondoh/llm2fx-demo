    "reason": "To achieve a bright sound for drums, the EQ emphasizes higher frequencies where brightness is perceived. Boosting around 1000 Hz to 5000 Hz enhances the presence and attack, crucial for drums. The high shelf starting at 8000 Hz further accentuates the cymbals' shimmer and overall brightness. A slight cut in the low frequencies around 80 Hz helps prevent muddiness, focusing the sound on higher frequency clarity."
