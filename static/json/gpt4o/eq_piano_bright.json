    "reason": "To achieve a 'bright' sound for the piano, emphasis is placed on the middle to high-frequency ranges. A small reduction in the low shelf helps keep the bass frequencies from becoming too prominent, which can muddy the sound. Bands 0 to 3 are adjusted to enhance clarity and articulation in the higher mids and above (500 Hz to 8000 Hz), where the brightness of a piano can be most effectively accentuated. The high shelf is given a significant boost to increase the brightness across the highest frequencies, adding sparkle and presence to the piano's tone."
