    "reason": "To achieve a 'church' reverb effect for piano, the reverb settings emphasize longer decay times across the frequency spectrum to mimic the spacious and reflective nature of a church environment. The low and mid frequencies are slightly attenuated to prevent muddiness, while high frequencies are boosted to accentuate the bright, airy characteristics typical of large, reflective church spaces. A moderate mix level is chosen to blend the natural piano sound with the ambient church reverb without overwhelming the original tone."
