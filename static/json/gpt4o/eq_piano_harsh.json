    "reason": "To soften a harsh piano sound, the EQ cuts are focused on the mid-range and higher frequencies where the harshness often resides. The band notches at 1000 Hz, 3000 Hz, and 5000 Hz alleviate the aggressive overtones and resonances that contribute to a harsh timbre. The subtle reduction at 8000 Hz helps in smoothing the higher harmonics, and the general shelf cuts help mellow out extreme low and high frequencies, ensuring they do not overpower."
