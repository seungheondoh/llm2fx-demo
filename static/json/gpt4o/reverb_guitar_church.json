    "reason": "The chosen reverb parameters emulate a church-like environment for a guitar by emphasizing mid to high frequencies with longer decay times to reflect the spacious and reverberant nature of a church setting. This creates a rich, enveloping sound with a mix level that ensures the guitar remains prominent while still capturing the expansive spatial characteristics typical of church acoustics."
