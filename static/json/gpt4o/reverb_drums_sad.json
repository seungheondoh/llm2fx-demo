    "reason": "To achieve a 'sad' sound for drums, the reverb is designed to produce a dark and reflective space with longer decay times in mid-lower frequencies, enhancing the melancholy character. The applied reverb mix is moderately high to maintain the presence of the sorrowful atmosphere without overwhelming the original drum sound."
