    "reason": "To achieve a 'warm' sound for drums, the EQ settings boost low frequencies and low midrange to enhance the body and fullness of the drums. The low-shelf filter accentuates frequencies around the bass drum's fundamental range, while band boosts enhance the presence of toms and the depth of the snare. Reducing higher frequencies a bit helps to tame harshness and give a smoother, warmer overall tonal quality typical of vintage or 'warm' sounding drum mixes."
