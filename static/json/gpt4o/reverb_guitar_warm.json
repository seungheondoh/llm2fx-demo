    "reason": "The 'warm' sound for a guitar is often characterized by a boost in the lower and mid frequencies with subtle decay to create a comforting and inviting atmosphere. The gain increases gradually from the lowest frequencies peaking around the low-midrange to midrange and then curves down to avoid harshness in the higher frequencies. Decay times are relatively even with slightly longer decays in the midrange for warmth and character, enhancing the natural resonance of the guitar. The mix is set to a moderate level to blend the guitar with a pleasant reverb without overshadowing the direct sound."
