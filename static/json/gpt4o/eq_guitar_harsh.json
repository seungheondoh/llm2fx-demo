    "reason": "The EQ settings are tailored to reduce the harshness of a guitar sound. By cutting frequencies in the mid to upper midrange (around 1000-4000 Hz), where harsh tones often reside, and slightly reducing extremes with low and high shelves, the overall sound is smoothed, yet the fullness in lower frequencies is preserved by minimal cuts in the low-end."
