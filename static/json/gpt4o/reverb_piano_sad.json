    "reason": "For a sad piano sound, the reverb needs to emphasize the mid and lower-mid frequencies to add depth and warmth, while higher frequencies are slightly reduced to avoid brightness, which would contradict the somber mood. Increasing the decay time gradually from mid to mid-high frequencies enhances the emotional resonance, while a moderate mix level ensures the natural clarity of the piano remains intact."
