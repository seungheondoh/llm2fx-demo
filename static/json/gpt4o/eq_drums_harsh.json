    "reason": "To reduce harshness in drums, I applied a combination of cuts across mid and high frequencies where harshness typically resides. The low shelf is set to slightly cut the low-end boominess, while more distinct cuts in the mid and upper mid areas around 250 Hz, 1 kHz, and 3 kHz reduce boxiness and piercing characteristics. A moderate high-frequency shelf cut at 10 kHz further smoothens any remaining harshness. Q-factors are set to balance the focus and breadth of these cuts to prevent dulling the overall sound excessively."
